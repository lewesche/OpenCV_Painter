Tracks colored objects in real time using the webcam and OpenCV, along with a few supporting libraries. So far it can track red, green, blue, yellow, and purple (kinda). Use it to track objects in real time, or just draw on the screen. Just for fun, but hopefully the basis for a sweet raspberry pi tracking project.
